# Google HashCode PlayGround

This project let you evaluate your submission files for the past editions of Google HashCode. 
This is a work in progress, so far I fully implemented the following scoring systems:
- 2018 Qualification round
- 2017 Final round
- 2017 Qualification round
- 2016 Final round
- 2016 Qualification round

Notice that submission files must be valid because the validation algorithms are only partially implemented.
